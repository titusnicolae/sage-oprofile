--  profiling for the symbench tests http://wiki.sagemath.org/symbench --

 
sage bench.py
	runs every python file in the py directory (these files where generated by sage in an earlier benchmark)
	oprofile profiles each file separately, it avoids the sage start overhead
	the opreport outputs are saved in the log directory

	reset() in the sage/py files destroys all variables, including the ones in the benchmark program, the benchmark fails
